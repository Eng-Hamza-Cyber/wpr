# WPR - WordPress Reaper v1.0
WPR (WordPress Reaper) is a high-speed, asynchronous security tool designed to harvest sensitive exported files and backups from WordPress upload directories through automated path guessing.

By leveraging the chronological directory structure of WordPress (/year/month/), WPR systematically probes for leaked databases, user exports, and configuration backups that are often left exposed by plugins or site administrators.

# Key Features
Asynchronous Engine: Built with asyncio and httpx for massive concurrency and high performance.

Chronological Fuzzing: Automatically generates paths from the year 2000 to the current date.

Multi-Variant Month Logic: Scans all month formats including numeric (01), full name (January), and short name (Jan).

Advanced Detection:

Directory Listing: Detects "Index of" pages to expose entire folder contents.

Soft 404 Protection: Uses Content-Type validation to filter out fake 200 OK responses.

Stealth Mode: Rotates through a pool of 20 unique User-Agents to bypass basic WAF patterns.

HTTP/2 Support: Utilizes modern protocol features for improved connection stability.


# Installation

## 1.Clone the Repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Eng-Hamza-Cyber/WPR.git`

## 2.Install Dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 3.Prepare Wordlist:
Ensure your db.txt file is in the root directory with the filenames you wish to target (e.g., export-users.csv, backup.sql).

# Usage

## Run the tool using the following command-line arguments:
Standard scan with default setting `python wpr.py -t https://example.com`

Start scanning from a specific year `python wpr.py -t https://example.com -s 2018`

Increase concurrency for faster results `python wpr.py -t https://example.com -c 20`


## Argument Reference
        Flag,                      Description,                 Default
     -t, --target ,       Target WordPress URL (Required),       None
     -s, --start ,        The year to begin scanning from,       2000
     -c, --concurrency ,  Number of simultaneous requests,         25

# Output
Any successfully discovered files or exposed directories are immediately logged to results.txt in the following format:

`[+] FOUND: https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/users.csv`

`[DIR] https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/`
